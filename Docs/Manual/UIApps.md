todo: write this doc

UI apps are small panels that display when you are flying the aircraft. You can configure which apps to show and how they're laid out. You can also create multiple profiles of apps to switch between.

discuss:
- profiles (add, rename, delete, can't delete default)
- app managing (add, delete, move, resize, configure?)
