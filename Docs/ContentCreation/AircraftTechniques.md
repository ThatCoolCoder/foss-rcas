# Intermediate and advanced techniques and tools for creating aircraft in FOSS-RCAS

todo: complete this document

This document contains a relatively unordered list of information regarding various aspects of aircraft creation. 

things to include (not all of them are programmed yet):
- detail of the stuff in aircraft toml file.
- wheels in general
- floats/water physics
- retractable landing gear
- custom cameras (fpv camera)
- custom aerocurves
- mixing
    - introduce regular controlhub
    - elevons
    - flaperons
    - flaps to elevator
- propulsion system
    - electrics
    - prop model
    - prop sound
    - propwash
    - this is too complex to keep as a subsection of a document, so break it out as we need a lot of discussion of tuning
- valuesetters
- easily having multiple variants of an aircraft (eg floats and wheels) through creating a base scene and then inheriting, if it's too radical to use valuesetter
